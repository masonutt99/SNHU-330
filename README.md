## 1. How do I approach designing software?

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I have gotten new design skills of making complex objects by joining simple 3D shapes.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?

I decided to create a scene first then figure out how to make the scene with the simple objects.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The tactic of keeping objects as simple as possible is probably a great idea. When objects become too complex they have more pieces that can break.

## 2. How do I approach developing programs?

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

A development stategy I used was to break the stages into smaller steps. Then to move on with each step.

### How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was used heavily in my development, I liked how each milestone I could build on what I started with.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I started out struggling with getting the additional libraries to work together. I learned how to do this and how to build off other peoples work and demostrations.

## 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I believe that computer graphics will help me in the future in many ways especially in the computer science realm. I can use the information I have now to help with visualizations of problems. 

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I think that understanding the shapes and objects will help me with my future. I think the linear algebra elements will help me with AI and ML.
